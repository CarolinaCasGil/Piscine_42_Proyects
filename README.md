# 🏊‍♂️ My Experience in the 42 Madrid Piscine  

Hello! 👋 I participated in the **42 Madrid Piscine**, an intensive four-week programming challenge designed to assess problem-solving skills, teamwork, and programming logic.  

## 🔹 What is the 42 Piscine?  
The Piscine is the entrance test for **42 Madrid**, an innovative programming school based on peer-to-peer learning and hands-on projects. During this month, participants develop knowledge in **C, algorithms, data structures, and shell scripting**, while also improving debugging skills and logical thinking.  

## 🔹 What I Learned  
During the Piscine, I worked on:  
- **C Language**: Variables, pointers, dynamic memory, functions, and structures.  
- **Shell Scripting**: Using terminal commands and small automated scripts.  
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**: Key concepts to optimize code and improve efficiency.  
- **Collaborative Work**: Pair programming and group corrections to enhance learning.  

## 🔹 Personal Experience  
It has been an **intense, challenging, and enriching** experience, where every day I faced new challenges, learned to manage my time better, and collaborated with other programmers to solve complex problems.
